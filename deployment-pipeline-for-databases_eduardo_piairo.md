Description
-----------

Database development should not live in a different galaxy from application development.There aren't many reasons (or uses cases) preventing us from applying the concepts and practices like source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery and narrow down the gap between applications and databases. Yes, I know databases have data!

In this talk will explore the different ways how to set up a deployment pipeline (using automation) and the different challenges in each stage: source control, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and how the decisions (migrations vs state approach for example) in each step influences the next steps.
